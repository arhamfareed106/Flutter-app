3.  **Firebase Setup:**

    -   **iOS**:
        1.  Create a new iOS app in your Firebase project with the bundle ID `com.sos.auto`.
        2.  Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner/` directory. Open it in Xcode and add it to the Runner target.

    -   **Web**:
        1.  Create a new Web app in your Firebase project.
        2.  The Firebase configuration is managed in `lib/firebase_options.dart`. You can use the FlutterFire CLI to configure it automatically: `flutterfire configure`.
